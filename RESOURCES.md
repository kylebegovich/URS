# Additional Resources

If these do not suffice, or you have additional questions about the work, please feel free to contact me by email: begovic2@illinois.edu

### The software
YOLO is free and open source, with a full tutorial on using the software on Redmon's site: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/


### Convolutional Neural Networks
Stanford CS231n lecture series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk


### Getting involved with the IGL
We take applications for undergraduate and team leader roles each semester, so check for the announcements about it coming up soon! https://math.illinois.edu/research/igl/projects


### Learning C programming
The software is mostly written in C, which is unfamiliar to many. I am taking CS241, which is taught in C, with Lawrence Angrave at the moment, and his wikibook for the course is online here: http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/wikibook/home.html
